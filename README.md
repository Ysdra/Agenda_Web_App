# Agenda_Web_App
This is a web application that allows users to plan their schedule for a typical 9:00AM-5:00PM work day. 

## Live Application Link:

## App Description & User's Guide:
This is a very basic daily planner that assumes the user is working off a normal 9:00AM-5:00PM schedule. This planner allows the user to enter and save any dynamic text within the localStorage of the browser for future site visits. It is highly recommended that the user utilizes Google Chrome as their browser when accessing this application. 

### Color Legend For Users: 

Past hours (hours that have already occurred) = gray

Current hour (the current hour of the day) = red

Future hours (hours of the day that are upcoming) = green

### How to Clear saved inputs (instructions for Google Chrome users):
1. Open the Google Chrome Console by pressing F12 key.

2. Select “Application” in the console’s top menu.

3. Select “Local Storage” in the console’s left menu.

4. Right click your site(s) and click clear to delete the local storage.

## Methodology:
This web application employs moment.js as a separate library for the time keeping elements and JQuery for the JS elements. Additionally, the localStorage property allows the user to store their input data even after leaving or refreshing the web page. Vanilla HTML and CSS are employed for the remainder of the code base to form the UI for the user.
