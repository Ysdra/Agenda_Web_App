# Agenda_Web_App
This is a web application that allows users to plan their schedule for a typical 9:00AM-5:00PM work day. 

## Live Application Link:

## Purpose
This is a very basic daily planner that assumes the user is working off a normal 9:00AM-5:00PM schedule. This planner allows the user to enter and save any dynamic text within the localStorage of the browser for future site visits. 

Color Legend For Users: 
Past hours = gray 
Current hour = red
Future hours = green

## Methodology 
This web application employs moment.js as a separate library for the time keeping elements and JQuery for the JS elements. Vanilla HTML and CSS are employed for the remainder of the code base to keep things simple.
